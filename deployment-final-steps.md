# 🎯 Final Deployment Steps - Almost There!

## 🎉 Great Progress!

Your deployment is 99% complete! Here's what we've successfully accomplished:

### ✅ Completed
1. **Azure Infrastructure**: Fully deployed and configured
2. **GitHub Actions Workflow**: Working and building images successfully  
3. **Azure Authentication**: Fixed and working
4. **Docker Build**: Successfully building your NestJS application
5. **Image Push**: Successfully pushing to GitHub Container Registry
6. **Container App Configuration**: Properly configured with all environment variables

### 🚧 Current Status
Your GitHub Actions workflow is successfully:
- ✅ Building your Docker image
- ✅ Pushing to GitHub Container Registry (`ghcr.io/aliozaltinbotel/voice-agent-botel:latest`)
- ✅ Authenticating with Azure
- ❌ **Failing at deployment** because the container registry is private

## 🔧 Final Step Required

**You need to make your GitHub Container Registry package public** so Azure Container Apps can pull the image.

### Quick Fix (2 minutes):

1. **Go to your package**: https://github.com/aliozaltinbotel/voice-agent-botel/pkgs/container/voice-agent-botel
2. **Click "Package settings"**
3. **Scroll to "Danger Zone"**
4. **Click "Change visibility"**
5. **Select "Public"**
6. **Confirm by typing the package name**

### Then:
1. **Re-run the failed GitHub Action**
2. **Watch it succeed and deploy your app!**

## 🚀 Expected Result

After making the package public, your deployment will:
1. ✅ Pull the image successfully
2. ✅ Deploy your NestJS application to Azure Container Apps
3. ✅ Be live at: `https://ca-media-worker-dev.blacksea-417b6c91.eastus2.azurecontainerapps.io`

## 🧪 Testing Your Deployed App

Once deployed, you can test:

### Health Endpoints:
```bash
curl https://ca-media-worker-dev.blacksea-417b6c91.eastus2.azurecontainerapps.io/health/live
curl https://ca-media-worker-dev.blacksea-417b6c91.eastus2.azurecontainerapps.io/health/ready
```

### API Documentation:
Visit: https://ca-media-worker-dev.blacksea-417b6c91.eastus2.azurecontainerapps.io/api

### Check Current Status:
```bash
az containerapp show --name ca-media-worker-dev --resource-group rg-botel-voice-v2-dev --query "properties.template.containers[0].image" -o tsv
```
Should show: `ghcr.io/aliozaltinbotel/voice-agent-botel:latest`

## 🔄 Future Deployments

Once this is working, every future deployment is automatic:
1. **Push code to main branch**
2. **GitHub Actions automatically builds and deploys**
3. **Your app is updated with zero downtime**

## 📞 Voice Agent Features

Your deployed application includes:
- 🎤 Voice Live API integration
- 📞 Azure Communication Services for phone calls
- 🗄️ Cosmos DB for conversation storage
- 📊 Application Insights for monitoring
- 🔒 Secure Key Vault integration

---

**You're literally one click away from having your voice agent live in the cloud!** 🚀

Just make that package public and re-run the workflow!
