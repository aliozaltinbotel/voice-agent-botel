# üîß GitHub Secret JSON Format Fix

## Issue
Getting "Content is not a valid JSON object" error in GitHub Actions. This means the JSON in the GitHub secret has formatting issues.

## Solution

### Step 1: Delete and Recreate the Secret

1. Go to https://github.com/aliozaltinbotel/voice-agent-botel/settings/secrets/actions
2. Find `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` and click **Delete**
3. Click **New repository secret**
4. Name: `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`

### Step 2: Copy This Exact JSON (Single Line)

**Important: Copy this ENTIRE line as ONE SINGLE LINE with NO line breaks:**

```
{"clientId":"5e298bcb-8ea9-4942-86e6-c54742c537c5","clientSecret":"J1C8Q~KLV5dc6YaYYoKeCAOiYP6nzxoRBWt4_bZt","subscriptionId":"25e4a027-53b5-408e-bf95-adce3c4aa503","tenantId":"fbb83cbf-ab23-4586-88b9-fcd26908b707","activeDirectoryEndpointUrl":"https://login.microsoftonline.com","resourceManagerEndpointUrl":"https://management.azure.com/","activeDirectoryGraphResourceId":"https://graph.windows.net/","sqlManagementEndpointUrl":"https://management.core.windows.net:8443/","galleryEndpointUrl":"https://gallery.azure.com/","managementEndpointUrl":"https://management.core.windows.net/"}
```

### Step 3: Paste Instructions

1. **Select all the text above** (starting with `{` and ending with `}`)
2. **Copy it** (Ctrl+C)
3. **Paste it directly** into the GitHub secret value field
4. **DO NOT press Enter** - it should be one continuous line
5. **DO NOT add any extra spaces** before or after
6. Click **Add secret**

### Step 4: Verify

After adding the secret:
- The secret should show as "AZURE_CREDENTIALS" in your secrets list
- No error messages should appear

### Step 5: Test

1. Go to **Actions** tab in your repository
2. Find the most recent failed workflow
3. Click **"Re-run all jobs"**

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

‚ùå **Don't do this:**
- Don't format the JSON with line breaks
- Don't add extra spaces
- Don't copy from a formatted JSON viewer
- Don't edit an existing secret (delete and recreate)

‚úÖ **Do this:**
- Copy the single-line JSON exactly as shown above
- Create a new secret (don't edit existing)
- Paste directly without modification

## Expected Result

After fixing the secret, your GitHub Actions should:
1. ‚úÖ Successfully authenticate with Azure
2. ‚úÖ Deploy your container app
3. ‚úÖ Show your NestJS application running

If you still get JSON errors after this, the issue might be with your browser or clipboard. Try:
1. Using a different browser
2. Typing the JSON manually (not recommended but works)
3. Using a text editor to clean the JSON first
